An early idea of what a social network analysis package could be in [Julia](http://julialang.org). Currently only supports undirected, unweighted graphs. Has the advantages of ease of use and fast graph modification routines.

Not affiliated with NetworkX, although I'm attempting to create a package that is similarly easy to use. Their work is fantastic: you can check it out [here](http://networkx.github.io).

This is an early version and it is useful to remember that there could be bugs. This code is not intended for use in a research context yet, and I assume no responsibility for errors causing the sky to fall, etc.
